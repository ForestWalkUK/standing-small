# Standing-Small

## *History Opened. Faith Defended. Christ Exalted.*

---

### Welcome

Welcome to **Standing-Small**, a project dedicated to documenting and exposing the major causes of Protestant Christianity's decline from the heights of the Reformation and Second Reformation to the present day—all from a **Reformed Presbyterian Covenanter perspective**.

More importantly, this site exists to point you to the **Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ**, the undiluted truth that has been obscured by centuries of error, compromise, and apostasy.

> *"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."* — Galatians 6:14

### The Vision

This site traces the theological, ecclesiastical, political, and cultural assaults upon the Crown Rights of King Jesus and His Church. We examine:

- **Ecclesiastical Apostasy** – The Counter-Reformation, Arminianism, the Oxford Movement
- **Philosophical & Cultural Apostasy** – The Enlightenment, Darwinian Evolution, Modernism  
- **Ecclesiological Degradation** – Erastianism, Independency, Sectarianism
- **Political & Social Corruption** – The Revolution Settlement, Acts of Union 1707
- **Modern Apostasy** – Ecumenism, Liberalism, Charismatic Confusion
- **Loss of Distinctives** – Abandonment of the Covenants, Sabbath desecration

But we don't stop at exposing error. **Every page points to Christ**, the only Saviour, the only hope, the only glory.
