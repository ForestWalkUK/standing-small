# The Oxford Movement: Romanising the Church of England

## Introduction

The **Oxford Movement** (also known as **Tractarianism**) was a 19th-century movement within the Church of England that sought to recover what its leaders believed to be the church's "Catholic" heritage. Beginning in 1833 at Oxford University, the movement—led by figures such as **John Henry Newman**, **Edward Pusey**, and **John Keble**—ultimately led many in the Church of England back towards Roman Catholic doctrine, liturgy, and practice.

Far from being a benign attempt at spiritual renewal, the Oxford Movement obscured the **Gospel of Jesus Christ**, reintroduced ritualism and sacramentalism, and hindered countless souls from finding salvation through faith alone in Christ alone.

This article examines the origins, teachings, and devastating legacy of the Oxford Movement from a Reformed Presbyterian Covenanter perspective.

## Historical Background

### The State of the Church of England in 1833

By the early 19th century, the Church of England had become spiritually cold and theologically confused:

- **Evangelicalism** was growing through the influence of men like John Newton, William Wilberforce, and Charles Simeon
- **Latitudinarianism** (theological liberalism) was widespread among clergy
- **Erastianism** (state control over the church) was firmly entrenched
- The **1832 Reform Act** threatened the church's political privileges

It was in this context that a group of High Church clergymen at Oxford began publishing a series of tracts defending the church's supposed "apostolic" authority.

## Core Teachings of the Oxford Movement

### 1. Apostolic Succession

The Tractarians taught that the Church of England possessed valid ministry only through an unbroken line of bishops stretching back to the apostles. This teaching:

- Elevates human tradition above Scripture
- Makes salvation dependent on church hierarchy
- Denies the validity of Protestant ministries
- Contradicts the biblical teaching on the priesthood of all believers

> *"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people."* — 1 Peter 2:9

### 2. Sacramentalism

The movement emphasised the salvific power of the sacraments, particularly:

- **Baptismal Regeneration** — the belief that baptism automatically imparts salvation
- **The Real Presence** — belief in Christ's literal presence in the bread and wine of communion
- **Auricular Confession** — private confession to a priest

This teaching obscures the Gospel by:

- Making salvation dependent on ritual rather than faith
- Inserting a human priest between the sinner and Christ
- Denying the sufficiency of Christ's once-for-all sacrifice

> *"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."* — 1 Timothy 2:5

### 3. Via Media

The Tractarians claimed the Church of England occupied a "middle way" between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. In reality, this was a rejection of Reformation truth and a slide back towards Rome.

## Key Figures

### John Henry Newman (1801–1890)

Newman was the intellectual leader of the movement. His *Tracts for the Times* (1833–1841) articulated the movement's vision. In 1845, Newman converted to Roman Catholicism, later becoming a cardinal. His departure exposed the logical end of Tractarian theology: **Rome**.

### Edward Pusey (1800–1882)

Pusey remained in the Church of England but continued promoting Catholic practices, including ritualism, confession, and monasticism.

### John Keble (1792–1866)

Keble's 1833 sermon, *National Apostasy*, is often regarded as the movement's starting point. He opposed the state's interference in church affairs but promoted Catholic doctrine.

## The Movement's Legacy

### 1. Anglo-Catholicism

The Oxford Movement gave birth to **Anglo-Catholicism**, a party within the Church of England characterised by:

- Ornate liturgy (incense, candles, vestments)
- Emphasis on the sacraments over preaching
- Prayers for the dead
- Devotion to Mary and the saints
- Confession to priests

### 2. Conversions to Rome

Hundreds of clergy and laypeople followed Newman into the Roman Catholic Church, including:

- Henry Edward Manning (later Cardinal Manning)
- Dozens of Anglican bishops and priests

### 3. Spiritual Darkness

Most tragically, the Oxford Movement obscured the **Gospel** for generations of English churchgoers. Instead of hearing the free offer of salvation through faith in Christ, they were taught:

- Salvation through sacraments
- Dependence on priests
- Works-based righteousness
- Ritualistic religion devoid of spiritual power

---

## A Reformed Response

From a Covenanter perspective, the Oxford Movement represents:

1. **A betrayal of the Reformation** — rejecting the biblical truths recovered in the 16th century
2. **A return to Romish error** — reintroducing doctrines condemned at the Reformation
3. **A hindrance to the Gospel** — obscuring salvation by grace through faith alone

The antidote to Tractarianism is the **pure Gospel**:

> *"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."* — Ephesians 2:8–9

---

## Conclusion

The Oxford Movement was not a recovery of ancient Christianity but a **departure from biblical Christianity**. Its teachings undermined the sufficiency of Christ, the authority of Scripture, and the freeness of the Gospel.

For those raised in Anglo-Catholic churches (as I was), the movement's legacy is not merely academic—it is **personal and painful**. By God's grace, I was delivered from its errors and brought to saving faith in Christ alone.

If you have been influenced by Anglo-Catholic teaching, I urge you: **look to Christ alone for salvation**. No priest, no ritual, no sacrament can save you. Only Jesus Christ, by His death and resurrection, can reconcile you to God.

> *"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."* — Acts 4:12
