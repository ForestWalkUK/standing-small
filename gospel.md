# The Gospel of Jesus Christ

## *The Heart of Everything*

---

### Why This Page Exists

Every article on this site exposes error, documents decline, and defends truth. But without the Gospel, all such efforts are ultimately meaningless. **You need Christ.** I need Christ. The world needs Christ.

This page exists to tell you the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ alone.

### The Bad News First

The Bible teaches that all human beings are sinners by nature and by choice:

> *"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."* — Romans 3:23

> *"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one."* — Romans 3:10

Our sin has separated us from a holy God:

> *"But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear."* — Isaiah 59:2

The penalty for sin is death—eternal separation from God’s blessed presence in Hell:

> *"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."* — Romans 6:23

> *"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."* — Revelation 20:15

We cannot save ourselves. No amount of religious activity, moral effort, or good intentions can reconcile us to God.

> *"But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags."* — Isaiah 64:6

### The Good News

But God, in His infinite love and mercy, provided a way of salvation:

> *"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."* — John 3:16

Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, lived a sinless life, and died on the cross as a substitute for sinners:

> *"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."* — Romans 5:8

> *"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."* — 2 Corinthians 5:21

On the third day, He rose from the dead, conquering sin, death, and hell:

> *"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept."* — 1 Corinthians 15:20

Salvation is offered freely to all who repent and believe:

> *"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."* — Romans 10:9

> *"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out."* — Acts 3:19

### What Must You Do?

1. **Acknowledge your sin** before God. Confess that you are a sinner deserving of His judgment.

2. **Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ**. Trust in His death and resurrection as the only payment for your sin.

3. **Repent and turn from sin**. True faith produces a changed life and a desire to obey God.

4. **Call upon the Lord**. Ask Him to save you.

> *"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."* — Romans 10:13

### Assurance of Salvation

If you have truly repented and believed, you can have full assurance of salvation:

> *"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life."* — 1 John 5:13

> *"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."* — John 5:24

### What Comes Next?

If God has saved you:

- **Read the Bible daily** (start with the Gospel of John)
- **Pray regularly** (speak to God as your Father)
- **Live for Christ's glory** in every area of your life

### What About Church?

Scripture commands believers not to forsake "the assembling of ourselves together" (Hebrews 10:25). Under normal circumstances, new believers should:

- **Find a faithful church** that preaches the pure Gospel and upholds the authority of Scripture
- **Be baptised** as a public profession of faith
- **Submit to godly oversight** and grow in fellowship with other saints

However, the situation in the United Kingdom today is grievous. Whilst there are many true believers and genuine congregations scattered throughout the land, there is presently no church in the UK that can be recommended without reservation. The nation has departed from God, and the visible church has, without exception, either abandoned or remains ignorant of the solemn National Covenants sworn before God in 1638 and 1643.

These Covenants—the National Covenant of Scotland and the Solemn League and Covenant—bound the nations of Scotland, England, and Ireland to uphold the Crown Rights of King Jesus, reform His Church according to the Word of God, and preserve true religion for generations to come. They were not mere historical documents, but sacred vows made in the presence of Almighty God, binding upon posterity.

The churches today stand as covenant-breakers, whether through wilful abandonment or culpable ignorance. Yet even in this, we acknowledge the tender mercies of the LORD, who preserves a remnant and remains faithful to His elect.

**What should you do?**

- **Study the Westminster Standards** and the history of the Covenanted Reformation to understand what has been lost
- **Maintain personal devotion** to Christ, knowing that He is building His Church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it

> *"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his."* — 2 Timothy 2:19
