<h3 id="why-this-page-exists">Why This Page Exists</h3>

<p>Every article on this site exposes error, documents decline, and defends truth. But without the Gospel, all such efforts are ultimately meaningless. <strong>You need Christ.</strong> I need Christ. The world needs Christ.</p>

<p>This page exists to tell you the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ alone.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-bad-news-first">The Bad News First</h3>

<p>The Bible teaches that all human beings are sinners by nature and by choice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”</em> — Romans 3:23</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.”</em> — Romans 3:10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our sin has separated us from a holy God:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.”</em> — Isaiah 59:2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The penalty for sin is death—eternal separation from God in hell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em> — Romans 6:23</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”</em> — Revelation 20:15</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot save ourselves. No amount of religious activity, moral effort, or good intentions can reconcile us to God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.”</em> — Isaiah 64:6</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-good-news">The Good News</h3>

<p>But God, in His infinite love and mercy, provided a way of salvation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</em> — John 3:16</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, lived a sinless life, and died on the cross as a substitute for sinners:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”</em> — Romans 5:8</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”</em> — 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the third day, He rose from the dead, conquering sin, death, and hell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.”</em> — 1 Corinthians 15:20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Salvation is offered freely to all who repent and believe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”</em> — Romans 10:9</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.”</em> — Acts 3:19</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-must-you-do">What Must You Do?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Acknowledge your sin</strong> before God. Confess that you are a sinner deserving of His judgment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ</strong>. Trust in His death and resurrection as the only payment for your sin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Repent and turn from sin</strong>. True faith produces a changed life and a desire to obey God.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Call upon the Lord</strong>. Ask Him to save you.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</em> — Romans 10:13</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="assurance-of-salvation">Assurance of Salvation</h3>

<p>If you have truly repented and believed, you can have full assurance of salvation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life.”</em> — 1 John 5:13</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.”</em> — John 5:24</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-comes-next">What Comes Next?</h3>

<p>If God has saved you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read the Bible daily</strong> (start with the Gospel of John)</li>
  <li><strong>Pray regularly</strong> (speak to God as your Father)</li>
  <li><strong>Find a faithful church</strong> that preaches the pure Gospel and upholds the authority of Scripture</li>
  <li><strong>Be baptised</strong> as a public profession of faith</li>
  <li><strong>Live for Christ’s glory</strong> in every area of your life</li>
</ul>
