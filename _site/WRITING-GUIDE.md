# Article Writing Guide for Standing-Small
**Version 1.0**

## Purpose

This guide helps maintain consistency across all Standing-Small articles, ensuring each piece:
- Exposes error with clarity and charity
- Defends biblical truth persuasively
- Points readers to Christ explicitly

---

## Article Structure

### 1. Front Matter (Required)

Every article must begin with:

```yaml
---
layout: article
title: "Your Article Title Here"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
category: [One of the six categories below]
excerpt: "One-sentence summary for the articles page."
---
```

**Categories:**
1. Ecclesiastical Apostasy
2. Philosophical and Cultural Apostasy
3. Ecclesiological Degradation
4. Political and Social Corruption
5. Modern Apostasy
6. Loss of Distinctives

### 2. Article Title

Use a **descriptive, compelling title** that clearly states the topic:

✅ Good: "The Oxford Movement: Romanising the Church of England"
❌ Bad: "Problems in Victorian England"

### 3. Introduction (1–2 paragraphs)

State clearly:
- What error/topic you're addressing
- Why it matters
- What the article will demonstrate

### 4. Historical Background

Provide necessary context:
- When did this occur?
- What were the circumstances?
- Who were the key figures?

### 5. Core Content

This is the "meat" of the article. Structure it logically:
- Use **clear headings** (H2 and H3)
- Present evidence systematically
- Quote primary sources where possible
- Cite Scripture frequently

### 6. Theological Analysis

From a Reformed Presbyterian Covenanter perspective:
- What biblical principles does this violate?
- How does this contradict the Westminster Standards?
- What does this teach us about church history?

### 7. Gospel Application

**Every article must end with a Gospel pointer.** Examples:
- "The antidote to [error] is the pure Gospel..."
- "If you have been influenced by [error], look to Christ alone..."
- "Only Jesus Christ, by His death and resurrection, can..."

### 8. Closing Scripture

End with a relevant Bible verse that either:
- Refutes the error discussed
- Points to Christ
- Encourages the believer

---

## Writing Style

### Tone
- **Charitable but firm** — Expose error without personal attacks
- **Pastoral** — Remember, real people are trapped in these errors
- **Confessional** — Write from conviction, not neutrality

### Voice
- **First person** is acceptable, especially for testimony
- **Active voice** preferred over passive
- **Direct address** ("you") is appropriate when applying truth

### Length
- **Target: 2,000–4,000 words** for major articles
- Shorter pieces (800–1,500 words) acceptable for introductory topics
- Longer pieces (5,000+) acceptable for comprehensive treatments

### Scripture Quotations
- **Always use Authorised (King James) Version**
- **Always include italics** (words added by translators)
- Format as blockquotes:
  ```markdown
  > *"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God."* — Ephesians 2:8
  ```

### Dates
- Use **B.C.** and **A.D.** (not BCE/CE)
- Format: "12 January 2026" (not "January 12, 2026")

### The LORD's Day
- Use "the LORD's Day" or "Holy Sabbath" instead of "Sunday"

---

## Research Standards

### Primary Sources
- Always prefer primary sources over secondary
- Quote historical figures directly where possible
- Cite specific documents, books, sermons

### Attribution
- Give credit where due
- Don't misrepresent opponents' views
- Acknowledge complexity and nuance

### Fact-Checking
- Verify all historical claims
- Double-check dates, names, and events
- When uncertain, say so

---

## What to Avoid

### Don't:
- Attack persons rather than positions
- Use inflammatory language unnecessarily
- Assume readers know theological terms—define them
- Write in abstract, academic style—be accessible
- Forget to point to Christ

### Be Wary Of:
- Chronological snobbery (assuming newer is worse)
- Oversimplification (history is complex)
- Guilt by association (fair critique only)
- Triumphalism (we're all sinners saved by grace)

---

## Gospel Integration

Every article should make the Gospel **obvious and accessible**. Options:

1. **Direct Gospel presentation** in the conclusion
2. **Clear link to Gospel page** with call to action
3. **Christ-centred application** throughout

Example endings:

> If you are trapped in [error], there is hope. Jesus Christ came to save sinners—not by ritual, not by works, but by His grace alone. Turn to Him today. Read more: [The Gospel](/gospel/)

> The only antidote to [error] is the **undiluted Gospel** of Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and rose again for our justification. Trust in Him, and Him alone.
