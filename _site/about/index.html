Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.”</em> — Romans 14:4</h2>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-vision">The Vision</h3>

<p><strong>Standing-Small</strong> exists to trace the historical, theological, and spiritual decline of Protestant Christianity from the heights of the Reformation and Second Reformation down to our present age. More importantly, it exists to point people to <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, the only Saviour and only hope for fallen humanity.</p>

<p>This project is written from a <strong>Reformed Presbyterian Covenanter</strong> perspective, holding to the Westminster Standards and the Covenanted Reformation of the Church of Scotland.</p>

<p>This is a test to see how easy it is to make additions and edits.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="why-standing-small">Why “Standing-Small”?</h3>

<p>The name reflects the apostle Paul’s teaching in Romans 14:4—that every believer stands or falls to his own Master, the Lord Jesus Christ. In an age of apostasy, compromise, and ecumenical confusion, those who would stand for truth often stand small, despised, and alone in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>But <strong>God is able to make us stand</strong>. Not by our strength, wisdom, or numbers, but by His grace, His truth, and His power.</p>

<p>The name also acknowledges the humility required in such a task. Who am I to trace the decline of Christendom? Who am I to defend the faith? I am nothing—standing small—but by God’s grace, I stand.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h3>

<p>I was raised in the <strong>Anglo-Catholic tradition</strong> and experienced first-hand the spiritual damage caused by false doctrine, ritualism, and the obscuring of the Gospel. By God’s grace, I was delivered from those errors and brought to a knowledge of saving faith in Jesus Christ alone.</p>

<p>This personal experience drives much of the passion behind this project. I know what it is to be hindered by error, and I do not want others to remain in darkness.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a coach driver, which leaves limited time for projects like this. But what can be done, by God’s grace, will be done—one article at a time, one truth at a time, one soul at a time.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal</h3>

<p>My prayer is that this site would be used by God to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Save sinners</strong> by pointing them to the Gospel of Jesus Christ</li>
  <li><strong>Expose error</strong> in all its forms, both historical and contemporary</li>
  <li><strong>Strengthen believers</strong> in the truth of God’s Word</li>
  <li><strong>Defend the Crown Rights</strong> of King Jesus over His Church and the nations</li>
  <li><strong>Recover the testimony</strong> of the Covenanted Reformation</li>
</ul>
